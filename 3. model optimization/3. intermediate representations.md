# Intermediate representation
Intermediate representation are OpenVINO toolkit's standard structure and naming for neural network architures.  
A `Conv2D` layer in TensorFlow, `Convolution` layer in Caffee, or `Conv` layer in ONYX are all converted into a Convolution layer in IR.

The IR is able to be loaded directly into the Inference engine, and is made up of two output files:  
one XML file and one binary file.

The XML file holds the model architecture and other important metadata, while the binary file holds weights and biases in a binary format. Both of them are required to run the inference engine.
