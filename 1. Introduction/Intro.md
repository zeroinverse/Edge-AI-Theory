# What is AI on the EDGE
The edge means local (or near local) processing, as opposed to just anywhere in the cloud. This can be an actual local device like a smart refrigerator, or servers located as close as possible to the source (i.e. servers located in a nearby area instead of on the other side of the world).

#### where is it required
The edge can be used where low latency is necessary, or where the network itself may not always be available. The use of it can come from a desire for real-time decision-making in certain applications.

The edge means thereâ€™s no need to send to the cloud; it can often be more secure (depending on edge device security) and have less impact on a network. Edge AI algorithms can still be trained in the cloud, but get run at the edge.

#### why is 'AI on the edge' important
1. privacy : personal data may not be ideal to be sent to the cloud.
1. real time performance : think of the AI camera in your new smartphone, would you wait minutes for when it uploads the picture to the cloud, process and then send it back, every time you click a picture?
1. efficiency : saves bandwidth, power and sometimes is the only way when the internet connection is not reliable.

#### applications:

There are nearly endless possibilities with the edge.  
IoT devices are a big use of the edge.  
Some classical examples:  

- Self driving cars.
- Forest poaching monitors and other real time cameras that monitor 24*7 for anomalies and illegal activities.
- AI playing agents for games like table tennis and Football.
- Smartphone camera AI enhancements.
