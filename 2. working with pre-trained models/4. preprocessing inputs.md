# preprocessing input images to use with our model

go to the documentation for any model that you want to use, see the input format and resize, transpose and format your image to match the model's input.

three examples are given below:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def pose_estimation(input_image):
# needs (1, 3, 256, 456) numpy array
    '''
    Given some input image, preprocess the image so that
    it can be used with the related pose estimation model
    you downloaded previously. You can use cv2.resize()
    to resize the image.
    '''
    preprocessed_image = np.copy(input_image)
    preprocessed_image = cv2.resize(preprocessed_image, (456, 256))
    preprocessed_image = preprocessed_image.transpose((2, 0, 1))
    print(preprocessed_image.shape)
    preprocessed_image = preprocessed_image.reshape(1, 3, 256, 456)
    # TODO: Preprocess the image for the pose estimation model
    print(preprocessed_image.shape)
    print(" ")
    return preprocessed_image


def text_detection(input_image):
    '''
    Given some input image, preprocess the image so that
    it can be used with the related text detection model
    you downloaded previously. You can use cv2.resize()
    to resize the image.
    '''
    preprocessed_image = np.copy(input_image)

    # TODO: Preprocess the image for the text detection model
    preprocessed_image = cv2.resize(preprocessed_image, (1280, 768))
    preprocessed_image = preprocessed_image.transpose((2, 0, 1))
    print(preprocessed_image.shape)
    preprocessed_image = preprocessed_image.reshape(1, 3, 768, 1280)
    print(preprocessed_image.shape)
    print(" ")
    
    return preprocessed_image


def car_meta(input_image):
    '''
    Given some input image, preprocess the image so that
    it can be used with the related car metadata model
    you downloaded previously. You can use cv2.resize()
    to resize the image.
    '''
    preprocessed_image = np.copy(input_image)

    # TODO: Preprocess the image for the car metadata model
    preprocessed_image = cv2.resize(preprocessed_image, (72, 72))
    preprocessed_image = preprocessed_image.transpose((2, 0, 1))
    print(preprocessed_image.shape)
    preprocessed_image = preprocessed_image.reshape(1, 3, 72, 72)
    print(preprocessed_image.shape)
    print(" ")
    
    return preprocessed_image
```
